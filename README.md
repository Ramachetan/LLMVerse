# Repository Guidelines

## Folder Structure
- Each new task should have its own dedicated folder within the repository. This ensures clear organization and easy navigation.

## Folder Naming Convention
- Follow the naming format: `taskXX-brief-description`, where:
  - `XX` is the sequential task number (e.g., 01, 02, etc.).
  - `brief-description` is a concise identifier for the task (e.g., voice-cloning-research, rag-pipeline-agent, etc.).

### Examples:
- `task01-voice-cloning-research`
- `task02-rag-pipeline-agent`
- `task03-gpt4o-financial-analysis`

## README Files
- Each task folder should contain a `README.md` file that includes:
  - **Task Name**
  - **Task Description**
  - **Goals/Objectives**
  - **References or useful links (if applicable)**

## Branching Strategy
- Create a new branch for contributions specific to a task (e.g., `name/taskXX-brief-description`).
- Once complete, raise a pull request and merge the branch.

### Example:
- If working on task 10, name the branch: `chetan/task10-financial-agent-llama-index`.
