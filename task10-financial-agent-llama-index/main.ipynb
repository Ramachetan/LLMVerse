        "# Learn how to build your own Multi-Agent Fundamental Analysis Workflow with LlamaIndex\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Agents\n",
        "By leveraging on AgentWorflow class from LlamaIndex, we'll create a multi-agent system composed of:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A fundamental_agent: Responsible for collecting ratios for a given ticker using the FinanceToolkit package\n",
        "\n",
        "- A profitability_agent: Responsible for gathering profitability ratios (ROA, ROE, Net Profit Margin, and Gross Margin) and analyzing their strengths or weaknesses compared to given thresholds. For example, if ROA > 5%, the firm is in a healthy range.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A liquidity_agent: This agent collects liquidity ratios for a given ticker (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio) and comments on these ratios given a set of threshold values. For example if Current Ratio is between 1.5-3.0 the firm is in a healthy range.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A supervisor_agent: This agent provides a final comment on the overall health of the firm based on the different comments coming from the different agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "I've limited my agents to 2 specialized ones, you can add as much as you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Agent's Breakdown:\n",
        "Then for each agent:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A clear description of the goal of the agent was provided\n",
        "\n",
        "- A system prompt of the agent's instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Tool (you can also provide several tools) that helps gathering the data needed and compare it to the set of the pre-defined thresholds.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The next agent to take the handoff.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tools\n",
        "There are 4 tools, each agent has a tool. Each tool can act and modify the State of the multi-agent system.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## AgentWorkflow\n",
        "Finally, the AgentWorkflow class puts all these together:\n",
        "\n",
        "- You list the agents to use\n",
        "\n",
        "- You specify the agent root\n",
        "\n",
        "- You initiate your state\n",
        "\n",
        "## LLMs:\n",
        "\n",
        "I used GPT-4o and compare it to the latest model of OpenAI GPT-4.5-preview.\n",
        "(I've used function calling because these agents supports natively tool calling).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Takeaways:\n",
        "- The workflow is easy to put in place\n",
        "- The agent's breakdown is well-defined, from its description to the system prompt and the next agents for handoff.\n",
        "- I called LLMs inside of the tools to provide insights on the ratios compared to the thresholds. Otherwise, I faced sometimes some hallucination...\n",
        "- The final answer from GPT-4.5-preview is well-structured compared to GPT-4o, providing key ratios, values, comments, and overall insights."

It's a deeply personal and philosophical question, and the answer often depends on your individual beliefs, values, and experiences.\n",

            "*   **Core Idea:** Life is inherently meaningless. There's no objective purpose or value.\n",
            "*   **Implications:** This can be a bleak outlook, but some nihilists find freedom in the absence of inherent meaning, allowing them to create their own.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Existentialism:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Core Idea:** Meaning is not pre-ordained; we create our own meaning through our choices and actions. We are born into existence without a purpose, and it's our responsibility to define it.\n",
            "*   **Implications:** Emphasizes individual freedom, responsibility, and the importance of authentic living. Key figures include Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus.\n",

            "**3. Absurdism:**\n",
            "\n",

            "*   **Implications:** We should embrace the absurdity and rebel against it by living passionately and authentically, even in the face of meaninglessness. Albert Camus is a key figure.\n",

            "**4. Hedonism:**\n",

            "\n",
            "**1. Return on Assets (ROA): 26.13%**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Score:** 10/10\n",
            "*   **Justification:** AAPL's ROA of 26.13% is exceptionally high. It significantly exceeds the \"Healthy\" threshold of >5%. This indicates that AAPL is highly efficient at using its assets to generate profits. For every dollar of assets, AAPL generates approximately $0.26 in profit. This is a strong indicator of effective asset management and profitability.\n",
            "*   **Insight:** This is a major strength for AAPL. It demonstrates the company's ability to generate substantial profits from its asset base.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Return on Equity (ROE): 157.41%**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Score:** 10/10\n",
            "*   **Justification:** AAPL's ROE of 157.41% is extraordinarily high. It far surpasses the \"Healthy\" threshold of >15%. This suggests that AAPL is generating substantial profits for its shareholders. For every dollar of shareholder equity, AAPL generates approximately $1.57 in profit. This could also indicate a high level of financial leverage, which, while boosting returns, also increases financial risk. However, given the other strong profitability metrics, it's likely a sign of exceptional profitability relative to equity.\n",
            "*   **Insight:** This is another significant strength. It highlights the company's ability to generate high returns for its investors. However, it's important to investigate the capital structure to understand the role of debt in achieving this high ROE.\n",

            "**3. Net Profit Margin: 23.97%**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Score:** 10/10\n",
            "*   **Justification:** AAPL's Net Profit Margin of 23.97% is excellent. It is well above the \"Healthy\" threshold of >10%. This means that AAPL retains approximately $0.24 of profit for every dollar of revenue after all expenses, including taxes, are paid. This indicates strong cost control and pricing power.\n",
            "*   **Insight:** This is a key strength. It shows that AAPL is effectively managing its costs and generating a significant profit from its sales.\n",
            "\n",

            "*   **Justification:** AAPL's Gross Margin of 46.21% is very healthy. It exceeds the \"Healthy\" threshold of >40%. This means that AAPL retains approximately $0.46 of profit for every dollar of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This indicates strong production efficiency and pricing power.\n",
            "*   **Insight:** This is a positive indicator. It demonstrates that AAPL is efficiently managing its production costs and maintaining a healthy profit margin on its products.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Overall Insight on AAPL's Financial Health:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Based on the profitability ratios, AAPL exhibits **very strong financial health**. All four ratios (ROA, ROE, Net Profit Margin, and Gross Margin) are well above the \"Healthy\" thresholds, earning a score of 10/10 for each.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Strengths:** AAPL demonstrates exceptional profitability, efficient asset utilization, and strong returns for shareholders. The company effectively manages its costs, maintains healthy profit margins, and generates substantial profits from its sales. The high ROE suggests efficient use of equity, but further investigation into the capital structure is warranted to assess the level of financial leverage.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Weaknesses:** Based solely on these profitability ratios, there are no apparent weaknesses. However, a comprehensive financial analysis would require examining other aspects of the company's financial statements, such as liquidity, solvency, and cash flow. Also, the high ROE should be investigated further to understand the role of debt.\n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, AAPL's profitability ratios paint a picture of a financially healthy and well-managed company. The company's ability to generate high returns on assets and equity, coupled with strong profit margins, positions it favorably in the market.\n",

            "*   **Score:** 3/10\n",
            "*   **Justification:** The current ratio of 0.8673 falls below the healthy range of 1.5 - 3.0 and is within the warning zone (< 1.0). This indicates that AAPL may face challenges in meeting its short-term obligations with its current assets. While not critically dangerous, it suggests a potential liquidity strain. The score reflects this concern.\n",
            "*   **Implication:** AAPL might need to improve its short-term asset management or consider strategies to boost its current assets relative to its current liabilities.\n",

            "*   **Value:** 0.745\n",
            "*   **Score:** 4/10\n",
            "*   **Justification:** The quick ratio of 0.745 is below the desired threshold of > 1.0. This suggests that AAPL might struggle to cover its short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets (excluding inventory). This reinforces the liquidity concerns raised by the current ratio.\n",
            "*   **Implication:** Similar to the current ratio, this highlights a potential vulnerability in AAPL's short-term financial health. The company should focus on improving its liquid asset position.\n",

            "**3. Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**\n",

            "*   **Score:** 5/10\n",
            "*   **Justification:** The debt-to-equity ratio of 1.8723 is above the healthy range of 0.3 - 1.5 and falls into the warning zone (> 2.0). This indicates that AAPL relies heavily on debt financing compared to equity. While not necessarily a sign of immediate danger, it suggests a higher level of financial risk.\n",
            "*   **Implication:** AAPL's high debt-to-equity ratio could make it more vulnerable to economic downturns or increases in interest rates. The company might consider strategies to reduce its debt burden or increase its equity base.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Interest Coverage Ratio:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Value:** Infinity (inf)\n",
            "*   **Score:** 10/10\n",
            "*   **Justification:** An interest coverage ratio of infinity indicates that AAPL's earnings are significantly higher than its interest expenses. In practical terms, it means the company has virtually no problem covering its interest obligations. This is a very strong indicator of financial health and stability.\n",
            "*   **Implication:** This ratio demonstrates AAPL's strong ability to service its debt, providing a buffer against financial distress. It suggests that the company's earnings are robust enough to handle its interest payments comfortably.\n",

            "**Overall Insight on AAPL's Financial Health:**\n",

            "\n",
            "*   **Strengths:** The extremely high interest coverage ratio is a significant strength, indicating a robust ability to manage its debt obligations. This suggests strong profitability and cash flow generation.\n",
            "*   **Weaknesses:** The current and quick ratios raise concerns about short-term liquidity. AAPL might face challenges in meeting its immediate obligations if faced with unexpected financial pressures. The relatively high debt-to-equity ratio also suggests a higher level of financial risk compared to companies with lower ratios.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Conclusion:**\n",
            "\n",
            "AAPL's financial health is generally sound, driven by its strong profitability and ability to cover interest expenses. However, the company needs to address its short-term liquidity concerns and manage its debt levels carefully. While the high debt-to-equity ratio isn't necessarily a critical issue, it warrants monitoring and potential mitigation strategies to ensure long-term financial stability. A focus on improving current and quick ratios would further strengthen AAPL's overall financial position.\n",
