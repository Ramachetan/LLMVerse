    "# Learn how to build your own Multi-Agent Fundamental Analysis Workflow with LlamaIndex\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agents\n",
    "By leveraging on AgentWorflow class from LlamaIndex, we'll create a multi-agent system composed of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A fundamental_agent: Responsible for collecting ratios for a given ticker using the FinanceToolkit package\n",
    "\n",
    "- A profitability_agent: Responsible for gathering profitability ratios (ROA, ROE, Net Profit Margin, and Gross Margin) and analyzing their strengths or weaknesses compared to given thresholds. For example, if ROA > 5%, the firm is in a healthy range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A liquidity_agent: This agent collects liquidity ratios for a given ticker (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio) and comments on these ratios given a set of threshold values. For example if Current Ratio is between 1.5-3.0 the firm is in a healthy range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A supervisor_agent: This agent provides a final comment on the overall health of the firm based on the different comments coming from the different agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've limited my agents to 2 specialized ones, you can add as much as you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent's Breakdown:\n",
    "Then for each agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A clear description of the goal of the agent was provided\n",
    "\n",
    "- A system prompt of the agent's instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Tool (you can also provide several tools) that helps gathering the data needed and compare it to the set of the pre-defined thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next agent to take the handoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "There are 4 tools, each agent has a tool. Each tool can act and modify the State of the multi-agent system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## AgentWorkflow\n",
    "Finally, the AgentWorkflow class puts all these together:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You list the agents to use\n",
    "\n",
    "- You specify the agent root\n",
    "\n",
    "- You initiate your state\n",
    "\n",
    "## LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "I used GPT-4o and compare it to the latest model of OpenAI GPT-4.5-preview.\n",
    "(I've used function calling because these agents supports natively tool calling).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- The workflow is easy to put in place\n",
    "- The agent's breakdown is well-defined, from its description to the system prompt and the next agents for handoff.\n",
    "- I called LLMs inside of the tools to provide insights on the ratios compared to the thresholds. Otherwise, I faced sometimes some hallucination...\n",
    "- The final answer from GPT-4.5-preview is well-structured compared to GPT-4o, providing key ratios, values, comments, and overall insights."

      "Ah, the million-dollar question! The meaning of life is one of those questions that has plagued philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries. There's no single, universally accepted answer, and that's kind of the point. The beauty (and sometimes the frustration) lies in the fact that **the meaning of life is often what you make it.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of different perspectives and approaches to finding meaning:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Philosophical Perspectives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.  This can sound bleak, but some nihilists find freedom in the absence of pre-ordained meaning, allowing them to create their own.\n",
      "*   **Existentialism:**  Emphasizes individual freedom and responsibility.  We are born into a meaningless world, and it's up to us to create our own meaning through our choices and actions.  Key figures include Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus.  Think of it as \"existence precedes essence\" - we exist first, then define our essence through our choices.\n",
      "*   **Absurdism:**  Acknowledges the inherent conflict between humanity's desire for meaning and the meaningless universe.  Instead of trying to resolve this conflict, absurdists suggest embracing the absurdity and rebelling against it through living authentically.  Camus' \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" is a classic example.\n",
      "*   **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the ultimate goal.  While often associated with immediate gratification, some forms of hedonism focus on long-term happiness and well-being.\n",
      "*   **Utilitarianism:**  Focuses on maximizing happiness and well-being for the greatest number of people.  Meaning is found in contributing to the overall good.\n",
      "*   **Stoicism:**  Emphasizes virtue, reason, and living in accordance with nature.  Finding meaning through self-control, acceptance, and fulfilling one's duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Religious and Spiritual Perspectives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Many religions offer answers to the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, and striving for spiritual enlightenment or salvation.\n",
      "*   **Buddhism:**  Focuses on overcoming suffering through understanding the nature of reality and achieving enlightenment.\n",
      "*   **Hinduism:**  Emphasizes dharma (righteous conduct), karma (action and consequence), and moksha (liberation from the cycle of rebirth).\n",
      "*   **Christianity:**  Belief in God, following the teachings of Jesus Christ, and striving for eternal life.\n",
      "*   **Islam:**  Submission to the will of Allah, following the teachings of the Quran, and striving for paradise.\n",
      "*   **Spirituality (non-religious):**  Finding meaning through connection to something larger than oneself, such as nature, humanity, or a universal consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Psychological Perspectives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Purpose:**  Having a clear goal or direction in life.  This can be anything from raising a family to pursuing a career to making a difference in the world.\n",
      "*   **Meaningful Relationships:**  Connecting with others and building strong, supportive relationships.\n",
      "*   **Contribution:**  Making a positive impact on the world, whether through volunteering, activism, or simply being a good person.\n",
      "*   **Personal Growth:**  Continuously learning, developing, and striving to become a better version of oneself.\n",
      "*   **Flow:**  Experiencing a state of deep immersion and enjoyment in an activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Practical Approaches to Finding Your Own Meaning:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Explore your values:** What's truly important to you?  What do you stand for?\n",
      "*   **Identify your passions:** What activities make you feel alive and engaged?\n",
      "*   **Set meaningful goals:** What do you want to achieve in your life?\n",
      "*   **Connect with others:** Build strong relationships and contribute to your community.\n",
      "*   **Practice gratitude:** Appreciate the good things in your life.\n",
      "*   **Be present:** Focus on the here and now and savor the moment.\n",
      "*   **Embrace challenges:**  Growth often comes from overcoming obstacles.\n",
      "*   **Don't be afraid to experiment:** Try new things and see what resonates with you.\n",
      "*   **Reflect on your experiences:**  Take time to think about what you've learned and how you've grown.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The meaning of life isn't a destination, it's a journey. It's not something you find, it's something you create. It's about living authentically, pursuing your passions, connecting with others, and making a positive impact on the world.  It's a deeply personal and evolving process.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what does *your* life mean to *you*? That's the question worth exploring. Good luck on your quest!\n",

The threshold for a healthy ROA is >5%, and even a moderate ROA is between 2% and 5%.  A negative ROA signifies poor asset utilization and inefficiency in generating profits from its asset base. It suggests that the company's investments in assets are not yielding positive returns.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Score:** 3/10\n",
      "*   **Justification:** TWLO's Net Profit Margin is negative (-2.45%). This means that after accounting for all expenses (including cost of goods sold, operating expenses, interest, and taxes), the company is operating at a loss. A healthy net profit margin is >10%, and a moderate margin is between 5% and 10%. A negative margin indicates that the company's pricing strategy, cost management, or both are not effective in generating profits.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Score:** 8/10\n",
      "*   **Justification:** TWLO's Gross Margin is 51.1%. This is above the healthy threshold of >40%. It indicates that the company is effectively managing its cost of goods sold (COGS) relative to its revenue.  It suggests that the company has a good handle on the direct costs associated with producing its services.\n",

      "*   **Weaknesses:** The negative ROA, ROE, and Net Profit Margin are significant concerns. These ratios indicate that the company is not effectively managing its overall expenses and is currently operating at a loss. The company is not generating returns for its shareholders or effectively utilizing its assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "TWLO needs to focus on improving its overall profitability. While the strong Gross Margin is encouraging, the company must address its operating expenses, interest expenses, and/or tax burden to achieve positive net income, ROA, and ROE. Strategies might include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cost Reduction:** Identifying and reducing unnecessary operating expenses.\n",
      "*   **Pricing Optimization:** Evaluating pricing strategies to ensure they are competitive yet profitable.\n",
