    "# Learn how to build your own Multi-Agent Fundamental Analysis Workflow with LlamaIndex\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agents\n",
    "By leveraging on AgentWorflow class from LlamaIndex, we'll create a multi-agent system composed of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A fundamental_agent: Responsible for collecting ratios for a given ticker using the FinanceToolkit package\n",
    "\n",
    "- A profitability_agent: Responsible for gathering profitability ratios (ROA, ROE, Net Profit Margin, and Gross Margin) and analyzing their strengths or weaknesses compared to given thresholds. For example, if ROA > 5%, the firm is in a healthy range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A liquidity_agent: This agent collects liquidity ratios for a given ticker (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio) and comments on these ratios given a set of threshold values. For example if Current Ratio is between 1.5-3.0 the firm is in a healthy range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A supervisor_agent: This agent provides a final comment on the overall health of the firm based on the different comments coming from the different agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've limited my agents to 2 specialized ones, you can add as much as you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent's Breakdown:\n",
    "Then for each agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A clear description of the goal of the agent was provided\n",
    "\n",
    "- A system prompt of the agent's instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Tool (you can also provide several tools) that helps gathering the data needed and compare it to the set of the pre-defined thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next agent to take the handoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "There are 4 tools, each agent has a tool. Each tool can act and modify the State of the multi-agent system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## AgentWorkflow\n",
    "Finally, the AgentWorkflow class puts all these together:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You list the agents to use\n",
    "\n",
    "- You specify the agent root\n",
    "\n",
    "- You initiate your state\n",
    "\n",
    "## LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "I used GPT-4o and compare it to the latest model of OpenAI GPT-4.5-preview.\n",
    "(I've used function calling because these agents supports natively tool calling).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- The workflow is easy to put in place\n",
    "- The agent's breakdown is well-defined, from its description to the system prompt and the next agents for handoff.\n",
    "- I called LLMs inside of the tools to provide insights on the ratios compared to the thresholds. Otherwise, I faced sometimes some hallucination...\n",
    "- The final answer from GPT-4.5-preview is well-structured compared to GPT-4o, providing key ratios, values, comments, and overall insights."

      "\n",
      "**Overall Insight on MSFT's Financial Health:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided ratios, MSFT exhibits a generally healthy financial profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Strengths:** The company's **Interest Coverage Ratio** is exceptionally strong, indicating a very low risk of financial distress related to debt. The **Quick Ratio** also suggests a healthy level of immediate liquidity.\n",
      "*   **Weaknesses:** The **Current Ratio** is slightly below the ideal range, suggesting potential for better management of current assets. The **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** is also below the healthy range, indicating that the company might be under-leveraged and missing out on potential growth opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "MSFT appears to be a financially stable company with a strong ability to meet its obligations. While its liquidity is adequate, there's room for improvement in managing current assets. The company's conservative financing approach, as reflected in the low debt-to-equity ratio, might warrant a re-evaluation to explore opportunities for strategic debt utilization to enhance growth. Overall, MSFT's financial health is robust, particularly regarding its ability to service its debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "📤 Output: Okay, let's analyze MSFT's financial health based on the provided profitability ratios and thresholds.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Current Ratio:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Value:** 1.275\n",
      "*   **Score:** 6/10\n",
      "*   **Justification:** A current ratio of 1.275 indicates that MSFT has $1.275 of current assets for every $1 of current liabilities. This is above the warning zone of < 1.0, suggesting the company can generally cover its short-term obligations. However, it falls below the healthy range of 1.5 - 3.0. This suggests that while MSFT isn't in immediate liquidity danger, it might not be optimally managing its current assets. It's not a terrible score, but there's room for improvement. A higher ratio would indicate a stronger ability to meet short-term obligations.\n",
      "*   **Implication:** MSFT is reasonably liquid, but not exceptionally so.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Quick Ratio:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Value:** 1.0572\n",
      "*   **Score:** 8/10\n",
      "*   **Justification:** A quick ratio of 1.0572 indicates that MSFT has $1.0572 of liquid assets (excluding inventory) for every $1 of current liabilities. This is above the threshold of > 1.0, suggesting a good ability to meet short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventory. This is a positive sign, as it demonstrates a strong immediate liquidity position.\n",
      "*   **Implication:** MSFT possesses a healthy level of immediate liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Value:** 0.25\n",
      "*   **Score:** 7/10\n",
      "*   **Justification:** A debt-to-equity ratio of 0.25 means that MSFT uses $0.25 of debt for every $1 of equity. While this indicates a relatively low level of debt compared to equity, it falls below the healthy range of 0.3 - 1.5. According to the provided thresholds, this could indicate that the company is under-leveraged. While low debt is generally seen as positive, a very low D/E ratio might suggest that MSFT isn't taking advantage of potential financial leverage to boost returns.\n",
      "*   **Implication:** MSFT is conservatively financed, which is generally safe, but might be missing out on opportunities for growth through strategic debt utilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Interest Coverage Ratio:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Value:** 44.879\n",
      "*   **Score:** 10/10\n",
      "*   **Justification:** An interest coverage ratio of 44.879 indicates that MSFT's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) are 44.879 times greater than its interest expense. This is exceptionally high and far exceeds the healthy threshold of > 3.0. It demonstrates a very strong ability to meet its interest obligations, even under adverse economic conditions. This is a very positive indicator of financial stability and low risk of default.\n",
      "*   **Implication:** MSFT has an extremely comfortable margin for covering its interest expenses, indicating a very low risk of financial distress related to debt.\n",
