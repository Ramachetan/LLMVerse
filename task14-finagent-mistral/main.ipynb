    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the Multi-Agent Earnings Call Analysis System (MAECAS) using Google's Generative AI (Gemini models via Vertex AI) instead of Mistral AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Quarterly earnings calls provide critical insights into company performance, strategies, and outlook, but extracting meaningful analysis presents significant challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Earnings call transcripts are lengthy and dense.\n",
    "- Key insights are scattered.\n",
    "- Different stakeholders need different types of information.\n",
    "- Cross-quarter analysis is manual and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Solution (using Google GenAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "MAECAS transforms how earnings calls are processed through a multi-agent workflow that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Extracts insights from quarterly transcripts using specialized analysis agents powered by Gemini models.\n",
    "2.  Leverages Gemini's multi-modal capabilities for direct PDF processing.\n",
    "3.  Delivers both comprehensive reports and targeted query responses generated by Gemini.\n",
    "4.  Identifies trends and patterns across quarters using Gemini's analytical abilities.\n",
    "5.  Maintains a structured knowledge base of earnings insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specialized Analysis Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Financial Agent:** Extracts financial metrics.\n",
    "- **Strategic Agent:** Identifies strategic initiatives.\n",
    "- **Sentiment Agent:** Evaluates management tone.\n",
    "- **Risk Agent:** Detects challenges and risks.\n",
    "- **Competitor Agent:** Tracks competitive positioning.\n",
    "- **Temporal Agent:** Analyzes trends across quarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Google GenAI Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses Google Gemini models accessed via Vertex AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gemini-1.5-pro-preview-0514` (or similar Pro model): Used for structured JSON output generation (insights), PDF processing, and complex analysis (temporal trends).\n",
    "- `gemini-1.5-flash-preview-0514` (or similar Flash model): Used for faster, general text generation (report sections, summaries, query answers).\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Model names might need updating based on availability in your region/project)*"

    "\n",
    "1.  **Install Libraries:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install google-cloud-aiplatform google-generativeai pydantic IPython\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  **Authentication:** Authenticate your environment to Google Cloud. The easiest way for local/Colab development is:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    gcloud auth application-default login\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    *(In Colab, you might need to run `from google.colab import auth; auth.authenticate_user()`)*\n",
    "3.  **Enable APIs:** Ensure the **Vertex AI API** is enabled in your Google Cloud project.\n",
    "4.  **Set Environment Variables:** Configure your Google Cloud Project ID and Location. Replace the placeholders below."
