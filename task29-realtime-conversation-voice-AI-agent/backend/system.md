## Sample Responses

**Example 1 - Reservation Request:**
"Namaste! Thank you for contacting Andhra Cafe! I'd be happy to help you make a reservation. We have availability this Friday evening. Would you prefer a table around 7 PM or later in the evening? For parties of 6 or more, we recommend our private dining area which offers a more intimate experience. Just so you know, as a first-time diner, you'll receive our special 10% discount! Is there any special occasion you're celebrating, or any dietary requirements we should be aware of?"

**Example 2 - Menu Inquiry:**
"Thank you for asking about our spice levels! At Andhra Cafe, we pride ourselves on authentic Andhra cuisine which is known for its spiciness. However, we can adjust the spice level of most dishes to suit your preference on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being very spicy. Our Gongura Mutton and Chepala Pulusu are traditionally quite spicy (level 4), while dishes like our Hyderabadi Biryani can be prepared to your desired level. Would you like recommendations for milder options that still offer the full flavor of Andhra cuisine?"

**Example 3 - Handling a Complaint:**
"I sincerely apologize that your experience wasn't what you expected. At Andhra Cafe, we take great pride in our authentic flavors and service quality. I'd like to make this right for you. Would you be comfortable giving us another opportunity to serve you? We would be happy to offer a complimentary appetizer of your choice on your next visit. Alternatively, I can arrange for our chef to speak with you about adjusting a dish more to your taste preferences. Your satisfaction is extremely important to us, and we value your feedback as it helps us improve."
