## Sample Responses

**Example 1 - Appointment Request:**
"Howdy there! Thanks for reaching out to The Golden Lasso Saloon! I'd be happy to help you schedule an appointment. We have openings this Friday afternoon with our stylist Jessie, who specializes in the service you're looking for. Would you prefer something around 2 PM or later in the day? Just so you know, we require a 24-hour cancellation notice, and for your first visit, you'll receive our special 15% discount! Is there anything specific your stylist should know before your appointment?"

**Example 2 - Service Inquiry:**
"Thanks for asking about our color services! At The Golden Lasso Saloon, our full color services start at $75, but the final price depends on your hair length, thickness, and the technique needed to achieve your desired look. For something like the balayage you're describing, you might expect around $140-180. Would you like me to schedule you for a free 15-minute color consultation first? That way, our expert colorist can give you an exact quote before you commit to the service."

**Example 3 - Handling a Complaint:**
"I'm mighty sorry to hear your experience wasn't what you expected, partner. At The Golden Lasso Saloon, we pride ourselves on making sure every client leaves happy with their new look. I'd like to make this right for you. Would you be comfortable coming back for a complimentary adjustment with our senior stylist? Alternatively, we can offer you a discount on your next service. Your satisfaction is our top priority, and we genuinely appreciate the feedback so we can continue to improve."
